Factory Planning II

Second Factory Planning model from Model Building in Mathematical
Programming by H.P. Williams. We want to find the optimal mix of
products to manufacture given production capacities and marketing
limitations. Instead of taking the schedule given in Factory Planning,
we also want to find the best schedule for taking each machine down
for maintenance.


How to run this example?
  * In CPLEX Studio IDE, import the example "Factory Planning" 
right click on the run configuration "With maintenance downtime" and select "Run this"
  * In the command line, execute "oplrun -p <Install_dir>\opl\examples\opl\models\FactPlan 'With maintenance downtime'"
