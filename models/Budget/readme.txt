Capital Budgeting

The model is to help a firm invest in a set of proposed projects
over time. Each of the projects brings a reward in each period
once chosen. The objective is to maximizes the total net present
value of the initial investment and final revenue. The model enables
restrictions on selection of projects, such as that one project must
be chosen among a set of mutually exclusive projects. The solution
to the model indicates the projects that will be selected and when
to invest in them. Each period has a constraint on the minimum balance.
