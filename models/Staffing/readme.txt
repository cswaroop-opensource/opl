Staff Assignment

A restaurant runs from 8am - 8pm on Monday - Friday. Each working day is
divided into three 4-hr shifts:

Breakfast:  8am - 12pm
Lunch:     12pm -  4pm
Dinner:     4pm -  8pm

Each shift demands three types of personnel: cook, cashier, and cleaner.
Each of its personnel is capable of performing a subset of these tasks.
Some people may not be available on certain days. If scheduled, each
person works 8 hours a day (2 shifts in this case), and prefers the
shifts to be consecutive. Also, if she works on a night shift, she
prefers not to work on the morning shift the next day.

The goal is to find a balanced assignment of workers to shifts that
minimizes on the total number of unfilled slots.
