Manpower Planning

Manpower planning model from Model Building in Mathematical Programming
by H.P. Williams.

Find a plan for recruiting, training, staffing, overtime, and declaring
redundant, to meet the staffing requirements for a facility over
the next years. Minimize redundancy, but also reduce costs. Assume all 
staffing changes are taken on the first of the year.

This model uses OPL Studio's flow control scripting mechanism by executing
the instructions with the "main" block.  You can comment out this block
to see how the program would be solved without using flow control scripting
and then add it back in to see how multiple scenarios can be implemented at
the same time.

How to run this example?
  * In CPLEX Studio IDE, import the example "Manpower planning" 
right click on the run configuration "Basic Configuration" and select "Run this"
  * In the command line, execute "oplrun -p <Install_dir>\opl\examples\opl\models\Manpower"
