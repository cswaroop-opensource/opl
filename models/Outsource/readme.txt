Outsourcing

A manufacturer is selecting a set of suppliers for the components of
its products. Different suppliers offer different discount schedules
- all-units discount or incremental discount. Each supplier has a
supply capacity on the total number of items. The model is to find
the purchasing quantities for each item from the suppliers to meet
the demands at a minimum cost. The costs include purchasing costs and
setup costs. A setup cost occurs whenever a positive quantity of any
item is ordered from a supplier.

Features:

- A mix of suppliers that offer either various discounts.
- Setup costs for ordering.
- Capacity limits for each supplier.
